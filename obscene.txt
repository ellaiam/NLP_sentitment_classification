__label__.obscene    ahem wtf are u talking about sire i do not practice vandalism
__label__.obscene   yes the money quote is that im fucking pissed off at the insistence of richard james continually harrassing me refusing to stop identifying my personal info as with posting my personal email above with website i have vandalized nothing but to take a letter or two off of my personal name and words that lead to my personal info in the slanderous and libelous and defaming posts of richard james i dont give a shit that my project is not listed here i found the whole process interesting and hilarious though quite hypocritical who can take the piss out of who here the article was about an art project not me i dont care that its not there it doesnt exist nor does bigfoot his compromise was on day two of the original posting of the project article a one man band who decides fist down who gets what and when like a fascist pig i could have campaigned for votes but what the fuckbefore final vote and deletion richard james posted an article about me without my desire nor consent and then deleted it in a violent fit of rage when i jokingly said the first article is dead at anothers insistence that it should be deleted then at seven days hes had the same hardon ever since as i said i dont give a shit but that his posts are defaming slanderous libelous and outright insidious his high and mighty accusational tone is what is weird and strange all i have done in the past two days is to delete letters of my name and project and the old username that i was attempting to expunge why  such posting can cause offence or embarrassment to the victim of the posting not least because it means that their name and any personal criticism or allegations made against them can then appear on web searches if you have posted such information please remove it immediately please then follow the link to this page and inform people there that the information was posted but crucially do not repost it on that page an admin or developer can then remove the information from the archives of wikipedia  wikipedia operates on the principle that every contributor has a right if they wish to remain completely anonymous wikipedia policy on that issue is strictly enforced posting private information about a user specifically their alleged name andor personal details is strictly prohibited as harassment and users who do that are often immediately blocked from editing wikipedia how is it vandalism to attempt to remain anonymous and to attempt to separate personal and professional reputation from libelous attacks

__label__.obscene i refer to peoples constantly taking the words of jimbo as policy the idea of removing any userbox with a political point of view is his point of view  thats at the core of this problem you did not notice that an admin skipped over the tfd process and speedied something when there is no rule explicitly against having an opinion in a userbox  rather there is jimbo saying there shouldnt be any  i completely understand that he started this but he is not owner of it a foundation was set up perhaps youve heard of it  the wikimedia foundation  i didnt say you had that same point of view im saying that i was just telling the people who do to fuck off  i made no attack on any editor that you perceive it as such is truly sad but such is life  perhaps with time you will learn the intricacies of the language  if one does not want personal pages on a site one should avail oneself to modify the source code in order to remove them from the site rather than complain that theyre being used  people who overstep the proper bound of their position should die that i have encountered multiple administrators so far doing so does lead to the desire to fuck off but im not done here

__label__.obscene    hahaha   check this out  mickmacnee an editor with a long history of block for disruptive behaviour 10 seems to have gone out of line in the last days i dont mind him being defensive of an article he has written the major part about and several users in the afd discussion have been very much engaged in it including myself however i object to the repated personal attacks and uncivil behaviour by the editor his history is rather long so i provide just a few selected diffs of uncivil comment and direct personal attacks during the last days 11 12 13 14 in the discussion on this page about a third user he calls my arguments for not agreeing with him evasion obfuscation interuption and intentional deafness that is rather typical of his attitude in the afd discussion where he agressively drives that everybody disagreeing with him are wrong ive tried to point it out to him 15 but with hindsight given our infected history it might have been better not to as i should have predicted how he would respond16 however im far from alone in having that opinion in the last days several other editors have also commented on his behaviour 17 18 19 20jeppiz talk   that block log looks like something out of a wikihorror storywhy has he not been given long blocks in the past i would go for a longerterm block ks0stm t•c•g   a users block log is not generally an excuse to throw the book at him this looks a bit silly if you ask me a bit of a tit for tat heated discussion over a article for deletion discussion that is split down the middle and nothing will come of it i cant find a really uncivil comment perhaps if you guys just edit different articles for a few days off2riorob talk   it goes without saying that everybody has different opinions but i do think that one of the nastiest and most repugnant editors either your comment was simply ignorant of the facts like you characterisation of my pov or you are simply trolling either way you are all out of credit here tbh ive got no idea what crappy papers you read its up to you if you want to parrot everybodys delete opinion as if it makes you look like you know what you are on about but it really doesnt are not particularly civil neither is i have had it with your crap in any case i wont interact with the user again i rather leave wikipedia as i pointed out im far from alone in having made these observationsjeppiz talk   off2riorob i tried your suggestion in fact i didnt think id need to try i didnt think id cross paths with mick after this bout of abuse but sure enough i did and when i reported him for violation of a 1r measure in place on the northern ireland article half of his defence was an assumption of bad faith against me i guess if someone keeps an eye on him he cant get too far out of hand alastairward talk   it is a bit of a rant he is clearly very upset about the footie and i am sorry you have been upset jeppiz he has gone now probably off to bed im sure one of the admins will have a strong word in his ear when he shows his face again i myself have had a run in with him but he has grown on me what can i say off2riorob talk   seeing the diffs alastairward provided i cannot agree even though i see that you stood up for him that time as well this is a user who seems unable to deal with conflicting views and routinely resorts to personal abusejeppiz talk   nothing routine about it your behaviour and alistairs are pretty similar which is why they provoked similar responses eventually if either of you wish me to lay out the full package of evidence for either of your extraordinarily sustained campaigns of tendentious behaviours i am only too willing to oblige mickmacnee talk   first of all alistair and i are not the only editors youve attacked and insulted there are at least grsz 21 and kevin mce 22 just in the last few days  while i have definitely argued with you i have not called you one of the most repugnant editors 23 called your contributions crap24 called you a lying hypocritical cunt 25 or told you to fuck off 26 27  every time someone brings your behaviour to the attention of administrators you come up with these vague and unsupported accusations that ones youve argued with have behaved in the same way it is not a defense then both should be blocked and its not true either just a dishonest way for you to try to talk you out of it im getting tired of having that same accusation thrown at me all the time and i take it as

__label__.obscene i have no idea why you are posting the slang definitions of fuck  that is a total nonsequitur  i have not seen anyone here assert that there arent any ways of using fuck that are slang  the point was and remains that the standard use of the word fuck as both a noun and a verb  the only ways that this word has been used in this entire discussion throughout this entire week up until your latest post  has been the standard definition that is widely understood and accepted as a normal word that is nowhere near slang  you used this nonsequitur as your basis for reversion  and to this day you are persisting in it  yet again another example of a huge logic disconnect that permeates this entire exchange  as for the metadiscussion the discussion about the discussion andys revert was based upon his assessment that the issue needed to be discussed before such a change could be accepted  and where did he choose to raise that discussion  over on my user talk page  that is the most inappropriate place to have such a discussion  i suggested to him that the discussion be moved here  instead he moved it to an admin page where he called for me to be blocked  is that the action of anyone who wants rational discussion  this too are questions that i do not need anyones answer to  as for your opinion that this issue is now resolved i never shared any such view  i added the see also link as a step in the right direction  not as a cure  i cant have stated that more clearly that i still see the article as broken  my decision to leave here for the time being is because i see a critical mass of editors who are bent on keeping it broken my opinion  my view  its fine if we agree to disagree but that doesnt mean that the problem has magically gone away

__label__.obscene   this needed to be clarified since there has been a problem with him inserting subsequent posts ahead of mine which can be misleading to a reader when i tried to correct the positions yesterday in another incident here is what he wrote in his edit summary when he positioned his post ahead of mine again  0157 13 may 2010 the magnificent cleankeeper talk  contribs m 180836 bytes undid revision 361800511 by zlykinskyja talkdont fucking move my comments again this is plain vandalism undo  so when i objected to his use again of the word fucking he then used it at me two more times as reflected above this follows a prior incident a few weeks ago when he used the word fucking at me i repeatedly objected and asked him not to do that i think he did this again because he knew it would upset me because of how upset i was about the prior incident   also i have been called by someone else a bitch and the words cunt and cock shit have been directed at me on this talk page i have repeatedly objected and nothing is done it is as if women who want to contribute here have to put up with a gauntlet of abuse if they wish to stay here and no it isnt unreasonable to object to such disrespectful treatment of women this is not the 1950s none of this should be going on   
__label__.obscene unblock 1 the reason i used sockpuppets was to avoid harassment from user dibo who immediately reverted all my edits   and  when i forgot to log and branded me a sockpuppet of some previous user here  which the checkuser proved did not exist  i got into a revert war with user tancred and user dibo who from the contributions seemed to devote their time exclusively to making trouble and aiding each other in edit wars as is shown here   as well as in the earlier case regarding user ehinger222 who they erroneeouslly accused me of being after several days of edit warring with user tancred over the right to call rugby league football footballsurely a neccessity and not erroneous user tancreds vandalism to the rugby league nations template here  the names of various sports on the marconi stadium site  and whether the aleague franchises should be referred to as clubspart of their franchise names egqueensland roar fc is a franchise and not a club but takes the name of a club for marketting reasons or franchises and whether minor premiers were premiers or not tancred has a history of edit wars exemplified no better than here i was banned by user chuq although my last free edits from here were this   my last was this   is where i made an argument for my case for the aleague case earlier i had asked chuq to please get a non soccer admin to help sort it out made in language not too different to chuqs   funnilly enough userchuq sent no warnings to userdibo and usertancred despite their equally uncivil and accusatry of vandalism here  i was not one at that stage as i was not trying to misuse the system and eing honest enough not to use this account to try to sway the argument   note the term pov rubbish i felt i was hard done by and resolved to annoy the blockers as much as they had annoyed me before resuming as my previous identity and making a large number of useful contributions before being bogged down by a piece of shit like userdibo who provoked this whole encounter userdibo and usertancred are the ones who should be banned if any justice is to be done and i am resolved upon annoying the whole lot of you unless i am unblocked and the usefullness of my 500 edits is acknowledged as actual contributions and userdibo recognised as the edit warrer that heshe it is
__label__.obscene  anyone who looks into this is going to see your harassment especially the comment you left on my talk page over the past couple of days youve been a real pain in the ass in the words of a fine canadian southern man better keep your head dont forget what your good book says   
__label__.obscene   neither you nor i are experts in the article subject matter least squares spectral analysis but i cited 2 references that literally say trigonometric functions while your references all refer to another method fourier analysis you freely interpret as to make it sound they refer to the article subject matter though it is obvious they do not in your mind as you claimed it explicitly fourier analysis is still the same as leastsquares spectral analysis which is obviously a nonsense because wp has two completely separate articles both featured on wp main page btw  so i do not believe anyone any more will buy your misusing of wikipedia regulations there is no reversals here not even technically speaking because what is going on is mine article author’s cleaning of all the shit you keep spraying around just like so many editors noted everyone just look at dicklyon’s talk page that you engaged in edit wars or insults exchanges with so far you are just a trouble maker around here and everyone sees you as such now stuff your imaginative misinterpretations of wp regulations to where they belong  no 3rr violation on my part but i know why you just threatened with reporting me it is because i already mentioned to you today that you are in violation of 3rr yourself sinusoids is another result of your imagination as no reference on lssa ever mentions it so it is not a reversal to remove your ignorance cleaning your shit is what it is

__label__.obscene im sorry i was an asshole about it  the point is that the vowels in man and noun are raised in ause according to felicity cox 2005 and the phonetic transcription for that idea example i gave you transcribes man as  and indeed it sounds like that to my ears although that speaker did seem a bit broad  its not that uncommon for vowels to be raised before nasals  take for example the pinpen merger in southern american english and in southwestern ireland or the nonphonemic ætensing that takes place in accents that have undergone the northern cities vowel shift  the only reason i brought this up is because i imagine it is very noticeable to english ears its even noticeable to my american ears  many english people might pronounce man as  which sounds quite a bit different from   youre the aussie here so im sure you can verify this by simply contrasting your man with your bad in this case both would have a long vowel so try to listen for the quality of the vowels or your noun with your loud  this is just another little thing that distinguishes aussie english from english english thats all

__label__.obscene   cash i am a walmart assocate and i do feel there is a link between walmart managment and servant leadership and here is why the managers are not in charge of the store the hourly associates are they take orders directly from the customers the customers are consitered under walmarts policies to be the boss the hourly assocates are next in that order and so on this is a backwards model that was set fourth by sam walton himself and is maintained by the current board grassroots survays are conducted every 3mos to a year this survey is a rating of each manager and is then reviewed by the district and regional vp then changes are made each level of management must answer to the hourly assocates and so it is kinda a pushpull managment system take my own situation for an example heres what happend one night i am short of assocates in the deliwhich is where i work temp logs did not get done of course this is a major mistake i was written up for this however i did not feel this was fair so i wrote an email to our district manager explaining the situation he then forwarded the matter to our regional vp our vp came to our store flew in from bentonville mind you to deal with the situation he met with me for about an hour and also met with some other deli assocates after a week he calls me and tells me that he can not get rid of the written warning however that all of the managers that had been informed that we where short would be on probation for the next six months i was satisfied with the outcome because while i was not fault free in the situation management however was informed that i did not have enough people to help customers and deal with the food safty logs and they failed to act accordingly and i was not happy with it so in the end i punished them for their poor perfomance so you can kinda see why they consiter it a servant leadership   also cash i hate the way you term vast leftwing conspiracy i am myself a liberal and we liberals are not part of that conspiracy ideal that would be your union leaders and rightwing large business owners that are antiwalmart as much as you would like to identify us liberals with the unions we are in no way assocated with them infact most of us liberals dislike the unions just as much if not more then you rightwingers because the general public tends to identify unions with the democratic party and this is because most union voters vote on the liberal side this does not mean that they are liberals just that they play the politics game true liberals hate the unions and feel that they are just as bad or worse then a currupt big business with a currupt big business atleast you know what they are and they make no bones about it with a union they want to be your friend and then screw you lol  on the part about this entry being pov it is very much so pov however i have given up tring to balance it out myself the antiwalmart people always revert your edit and then threaten to get you banned for the three revert rule when you attempt to make any edits its a freaking joke the way they act however i have just taken on the idea that they will destroy the entry to the point where people look at it and just shake their heads and how full of bs it is

__label__.obscene unblockthank you for a reasonable fucking comment the only user in any area who has actually made one  ebyabe made comments which appear to be reasonable at first glance but are actually unreasonable because one is fraudulent and the other was untrue regarding a place where she could see that it was untrue  well a sortof reasonable comment anyway because he claims that i am being confrontational when it is clearly visible at my talk page that other users are attacking me and not the other way around  i have not caused any confrontation   i have replied to other users who are putting a confrontation to me  i did ask how to report a user but i did not actually report him because nobody answered regardless of several posts made and the user himself did not comment there so that was not a confrontation like it would have been if id been able to make the report  i would like to leave a message at this user userstwalkersters talk page but i cannot because for some reason those are blocked to so i have to do it this way instead  hopefully he has the notifications turned on tags of username  i can be calm and work with other people  this is noted in my first reply where it gives several examples of how users should have had discussion instead of attacking and reverting me and arguing hostilely on my talk page  users who wish to work with me should not make attacks write words like compliance revert edits when they could have further fixed the edit instead details of referredto edits in a separate paragraph below make false claims against me or delete my replies on discussion pages not talk pages and then archive it after removing them  users should not do these kinds of things to anyone  what this means is that if users act in a reasonable manner then a normal discussion can ensue including from myself  merely because someone has used a template written a shorter reply or wrote their aggressive confrontational remarks in a businessstyle manner does not mean that they are being reasonable or writing nicely  when someone makes a falsified report about you or writes a falsified comment etc it is not reasonable to expect the victim to reply without mentioning this or to want to be friends with the attacker  if the other people are being reasonable then of course i am going to reply to them in a different way  editing an article bybelow is not reasonable nor is ganging up the discussion page nor is replying in several places at once etc  how can replying to other users stating bad andor false things about you be confrontational  i have mentioned several times about having an actual discussion but no one did this and instead just kept replying on my talk pages  the fact that i mentioned having a discussion indicates that i think reasonable discussion is the right or reasonable way to do it  just no one wanted to do anything but attack me so i did not have another way  the headlines are not veiled they are in plain light  it was not any attempt to be hidden  for headline 5 i literally do or did not know of a different way to title this headline which is not an attack on myself  for headline 8 it is truthful and the falsification was blatant by ebyabe and i actually expected her to edit it to something on her next message  i mean she directly mentions it edit summary says a reason but her message says differently directly not implied  for this headline it is not a personal attack because it is true and evident administrator complains about my signature even though signature has been changed and messages by me since posted before the block happened as well as direct linking to comments which contain no personal attacks as a reason for personal attacks  if the titles were untrue they would be attacks but since they are true unambiguously then they cant be attacks the last headline yes somewhat motivatedhostile because he is the one put an useless headline so that theres two at once after my notice is up while also writing the things that show the actual tyranny a word used in this case solely because it is already being talked about and not meant as any attackinstigationhostileetc although the link by jamie appears to say something about political opinions if someone is making false claims then it is appropriate for them to be exposed  so as you can see my intents are to be reasonable and normal with the possible exception of this particular headline and repeatedly asking other people to do this but being annoyed by all their attacks and false remarks as well  edits in a separate paragraph so that reading it is optional users working with me should notrevert edits when they could have further fixed the edit instead  instead of reverting multiple times attacking and then harassing the use

__label__.obscene you reported me to aiv hilarious thats one of the dick moves werieth pulled too although he only did it as he knew reporting me to spi would have probably brought him to much attention  at that stage he was still trying to keep the whole thing quiet as it obviously benefited him not that he need have worried  every admin that ever responded to him either at spi or aiv took the exact same view of my socking as as you espouse here although obviously some were motivated by more than just incompetence as such its likely your report to aiv is only going to ensure their names dont get picked up and the systemsattitudesculture that cause this obviously counterproductive reaction dont get fixed  meaning that werieth might as well try his arm at another return later it speaks volumes that youd think reverting me was remotely a good thing even though in that very same ani theres an arb explaining how he could have probably picked up on this whole thing much earlier if it wasnt for just that sort of mindless cycle of reversion and blocking of obvious socks on the basis all socking is ebil its beyond idiotic
__label__.obscene   correct that you havent wandered off correct that i didnt know you were addressing the pink oboes entire editing history in the one diff to his talk page and for cleaning house  money  mouth  stephan schulz  no way is this civility business ever going to be anything but a double standard and a joke if malleus gets blocked for arse while admins can tell two editors to shut the fuck up and not an eyelash is batted an an  if were serious lets start where the problem starts admin abuse and double standards in enforcement of civility and personal attacks   talk

__label__.obscene   the various local government areas pages only list them  i was thinking something like that  these three paragraphs are from a couple of papers i wrote they can be incorporated into the article    the states and territories run the majority of the government in australia and devolve some of this power down to local government local councils  because this devolution of power happens on a state by state basis in different states the local councils have different powers  though generally they provide water sewerage and look after local roads with the states looking after health education police and so on  tasmania like the other states has a constitution  unlike the australian constitution the tasmanian one is simply an act of parliament as such to change it requires no more then a majority in the parliament not a referendum  this constitution among other things establishes local government in part iva  local government tasmanian constitution  however this part while establishing the fact that councils will exist leaves open how they are operated and what their powers are  both the system and power of the councils being provided by the parliament  from time to time tasmanian constitution  it is the local government act 1993 referred hereafter to as either the lga or the act that currently provides for the creation of the various councils the role of the councillors what power the councils have and so on    the act requires that the various councils provide for the health safety and welfare of the community represent and promote the interests of the community and provide for the peace order and good government of the municipal area  generally the act permits councils to do anything necessary or convenient to perform its functions either within or outside its municipal area  specifically the act provides for the various councils to have the following powers among others to charge land rates service rates special rates and to levy fines in relation to bylaws and to make bylaws in respect to anything the council has power to do  im sure the other states have similar legislation   fuck you

__label__.obscene harun yahyaadnan oktar   this is quoted from the wikipedia article on harun yahya  even though he often writes about science he has never actually studied any science at a university level      there are also many disturbing data in that article he claims to be a moral authority and an expert on muslim ethics but has anal and oral sex with children claiming that it is halal if we are to keep his work in this article he needs to be demonstrated as having some standing as a quranic scholar is he so received in the muslim world is there any evidence for this
__label__.obscene   the users final edit was to blank his talk page with the edit summary fuck it  the page blanking was reverted because of an active block  the block is no longer active the user has not returned to wikipedia and i think it is pretty clear that fuck it is the equivalent of i am retiring from wikipedia  it seems to me that if someone has expressed quite clearly that they dont want to come back to wikipedia and that they dont want their sad saga displayed on their talk page for all eternity that is within their rights also i question whether the initial reversion of the page blanking was even according to policy  show me one policy that says you cannot blank active block messages on your talk page hmmm  while wpdrc is merely a guideline there is a distinct lack of wikipedia policy limiting what kind of content users can remove from their talk page  i happen to think there should be policy limiting what a person is allowed to remove from their own talk page eg warnings 24 hours old and active block notices but as it currently stands there is no such policy at least not that i can find  if i am wrong please enlighten me if i have to abide by rules i think are dumb then so does everybody else  in fact that is the difference between us and karaku  karaku disagreed with the rules so he chose to aggressively break them and call everyone else ignorant  i disagree with the rules but i realize they have been formed by community consensus and so i will abide by them as long as they are in place  and by my interpretation of the current rules karakus blanking of the talk page should never have been reverted   furthermore while i recognize that i was using the word vanish imprecisely it appears to be a longstanding tradition in wikipedia that if a user wants to just leave and clear out the ugly history of their wrongdoing they have the right to do that  karaku very clearly indicated a desire to do just that is there really that much difference between putting a banner saying retired at the top of your talk page vs blanking the thing with the edit summary fuck it anyway im obviously not going to get in an edit war over a retired users talk page  im just sort of surprised at the insistence to leave all this stuff in place when the user doesnt want it and wikipedia policy provides no mechanism to override those wishes   
__label__.obscene    bone to pick friendschris evans   alright ive waited my week long block to type this whats the big deal that other ip you blocked brought up a good point jon favreau lists friends namely vince vaughn leonardo dicaprio does kate winslet too but my question is that why is it fine to have it on their articles but here its a huge problem and theres always a million excuses trivia or lousy content all im doing is going off what the other articles on this site did and added it as hell it should be considered passable due to the amount of films they did together at least note that on the article but no whenever i add it the response i get is the equivalent of being told to go fuck myself im only trying to help out just because im an ip doesnt give you the right to push me around and treat e like shot

__label__.obscene  calling someone daft is a wpnpapersonal attack and bullshit warnings is likewise uncollegial so i recommend that you calm down and redact yourself i also reserve the right to leave appropriate templates on your talk page as is required of me if you read wpsps which i did youll find that it explicitly makes an exception for experts in the field like callahan you also didnt deny that blp is irrelevant i believe ive clearly shown that you are wrong on the basis of policy so im asking you again to revert yourself and avoid sanctions

__label__.obscene simcopter shenanigans hiya i originally followed this controversy in pc gamer my god back when printed magazines were worth a shit so off the top of m yhead i didnt have any sites   i remember there being a few geocities webpages on simcopter but by the time i had graphical internet circa 1998 it was already considered an old school game  one page i found while googling that mentions the controversy is httpwwwlangstoncomfunpeople19961996cfmhtml  another is httplistssamuraicompipermailbryanslist1996december001811html  apparently the programmer who inserted this easter egg was fired go figure  and here we have people trying to push the view that the clinton years were all about tolerance what a load   anyway before i go off on a political tangent check out those sites and ill try to find some actual simcopter sites at some point though i get the feeling this will be a fruitless endeavor
__label__.obscene  years after hansons death will her biographer sit down and include this incident and her reaction ive written articles on australian historical figures—from the left and the right—and i dont include petty bullshit like this further point is that it is irrelevant to her entire life and career so many wikipedia articles arent a proper biography theyre slap from this media article and slap from that media article based on the idea that it was said or done so it must be there irrelevant of how petty or nonnotable it is its why articles on modernday extremists whatever their creed are so bad because theyre just conduits for media crap ie something negative was said about the person at hand so it therefore must be slapped in the article this is done under the guise of it being notable but it is in reality just an editor taking an oppourtunity to attack the person at hand  do not think im blind i see through the bullshit whether it comes from you or the media i havent moved away from my earlier points because im sticking to my guns im merely elaborating on them further in the hope to getting the point across to you and your comrades  nice try at baiting me though  talk
